# SPECTRUM 

Project Report

The project we were given can be divided in 3 parts
in which we were given projects on most important python libraries.

1.Numpy-       help to carry various operations on array and matrices
2.Pandas-      for cleaning and manipulating data 
3.scikit-learn-for data analysis 
4.matplotlib-  help in visualisation


Through a series of tasks we were finally able to implement multiple linear regression by which we were  able to predict scores of students.We also were able to avoid overfitting and successfully able to increase the accuracy of our final prediction by eleminating 
some dependant variables.



I sincerely thank spectrum team for providing me this oppurtunity and taking such nobel initiative.
